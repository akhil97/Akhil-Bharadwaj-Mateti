### **[Project 1: AI Models for Legal Text Processing](https://github.com/akhil97/Final-Project-Group3)**
 - Used state-of-the-art transformer models fine-tuned on legal text data. We focused on key tasks such as text classification, text generation, and text summarization using BERT, GPT-2, and PEGASUS. 
 - Designed streamlit app where user can upload legal documents and summarize text.
 - Fine-tuned PEGASUS model on indian legal documents for text summarization task.
 - Published the model on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/akhilm97/pegasus_indian_legal)

### **[Project 2: Used Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/akhil97/Cloud-Computing-Project)**
 - Designed a Streamlit app to predict the price of used cars based on inputs provided by users like manufacturer name, engine type, and production year.
 - Employed AWS services like AWS Sagemaker for training XGBoost regression model and AWS EC2 instance for streamlit app.
 - Obtained R2 score of 90% for the XGBoost regression model.  

### **[Project 3: Automatic Ship Classification from Satellite Images](https://github.com/akhil97/Final-Project-Group2)**
 - Classified optical aerial images of ships to monitor unlawful activities in international waters.  
 - Captured images in visible spectrum by employing transfer learning models on multi-class imbalanced dataset.
 - Achieved 78% F1 score using VGG16 pre-trained model.

### **[Project 4: Forest cover prediction](https://github.com/akhil97/Final-Project-Group7)**
 - Predicted forest cover type for use by agricultural industry to identify areas suitable for timber harvesting.
 - Employed Sklearnâ€™s calibration APIs for finding best set of hyperparameters. 
 - Implemented XGBoost classifier and achieved 93% F1-score.
 

### **[Project 5: Heart disease prediction](https://github.com/akhil97/Data_Mining_project-T4-DATS6103)**
- Improved AUC score to 72% from 54% after balancing data using SMOTE and furnished insights on factors affecting heart disease with the help of EDA, correlation matrix, VIF values and implemented logistic regression.

### **[Project 6: Bank churn prediction](https://github.com/akhil97/Data_Science_project-T4-DATS6101)**
- Performed statistical tests to figure out important attributes affecting customer churn, applied SMOTE technique to handle imbalanced data and implemented logistic regression model achieving an AUC of 74.5%.
