 - Used state-of-the-art transformer models fine-tuned on legal text data. We focused on key tasks such as text classification, text generation, and text summarization using BERT, GPT-2, and PEGASUS. 
 - Designed streamlit app where user can upload legal documents and summarize text.
 - Fine-tuned PEGASUS model on indian legal documents for text summarization task.
 - Published the model on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/akhilm97/pegasus_indian_legal)

### **[Project 2: Used Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/akhil97/Cloud-Computing-Project)**
 - Designed a Streamlit app to predict the price of used cars based on inputs provided by users like manufacturer name, engine type, and production year.
 - Employed AWS services like AWS Sagemaker for training XGBoost regression model and AWS EC2 instance for streamlit app.
 - Obtained R2 score of 90% for the XGBoost regression model.
