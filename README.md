### **Project1: AI Models for Legal Text Processing**
Used state-of-the-art transformer models fine-tuned on legal text data. We focus on key tasks such as text classification, text generation, and text summarization using BERT, GPT-2, and PEGASUS. Designed streamlit website where user can upload legal documents and summarize text.

#### **Our Transformer Models Include:**

- **BERT**: Specialized in sequence classification and sentiment analysis.
- **GPT-2**: Designed for advanced text generation.
- **PEGASUS**: Expert at concise text summarization.

#### **Training Datasets:**

The models are fine-tuned on diverse legal datasets:
- **ILDC Dataset**: Used for BERT in text classification.
- **Legal Contracts Dataset**: The basis for GPT-2's text generation capabilities.
- **Indian Legal Documents**: Aids PEGASUS in summarization tasks.
